**What is Axios and how is it used in React?**

Axios is a JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js. In React, it is commonly used to fetch data from APIs by integrating it within components, often in conjunction with hooks like useEffect to handle side effects and update state with the fetched data.

**What is the role of useEffect in React and how does it relate to data fetching?**

useEffect is a React hook used to manage side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations, after the component renders. For data fetching, it ensures API calls are made at the appropriate time (e.g., when the component mounts or dependencies change), and the resulting data can be stored in state.
