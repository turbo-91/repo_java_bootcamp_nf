**What does the abbreviation 'HTML' stand for and what is it used for in web development?**

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to structure content on the web using various tags to organize text, images, links, and other media.

**Name at least five common HTML tags and describe their usage.**

Common HTML tags include &lt;h1> to &lt;h6> for headings, &lt;p> for paragraphs, &lt;a> for hyperlinks,  &lt;img> for images, and &lt;ul> for unordered lists.

**Why is it important to use semantically correct HTML code?**

Semantically correct HTML enhances accessibility, improves SEO, and ensures a clean, maintainable code structure, benefiting both search engines and users with assistive technologies.

**Your coworker wants to make the title on your website larger. He changes: &lt;h3&gt;title&lt;/h3&gt; =&gt; &lt;h1&gt;title&lt;/h1&gt; Why is this approach not good? And what would you recommend to your coworker?**

This approach is not ideal as it disrupts the semantic document structure; instead, I would recommend using CSS to adjust the font size while maintaining the correct heading hierarchy.
